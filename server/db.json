It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.\t\t\t\r\n2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"

It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, allowances and bonuses but exclude employer CPF contributions.\t\t\r\n2) Data cover full-time and part-time employees who have CPF contributions. They exclude identifiable self-employed persons who have made CPF contribution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3) Average (Mean) Monthly Earnings covers employees who contribute to the Central Provident Fund. Available quarterly, AME provides a timely rough gauge of average wage movement. However, the AME can be influenced by the changing mix of full-time and part-time workers and variations in overtime as the data are compiled based on the payroll of contributors to the CPF which do not allow for breakdown separately to full-timers and part-timers. Also, as AME pertains to mean earnings, it can be skewed upwards by a small number of very high income earners. For income of a typical worker, users should refer to the median Gross Monthly Income From Work and for wage growth of employees over a year they can refer to the Annual Wage Changes, both of which are available on MOM’s website.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n"

Each licence application is assessed on its own merits. Here is a self-checklist for easy reference on the requirements to fulfill.\r\n\r\nIn general, NEA will issue a foodshop licence when the following conditions are met with: \r\n\r\nCompliance with the Code of Practice of Environmental Health (COPEH) and operational requirements for foodshops, which covers areas like minimum kitchen size, refuse management, noise and cooking fumes control etc.  Please study the requirements appended. They will be verified through a pre-licensing check of the premises upon the completion of renovations and installation of equipment. \r\n Submission of relevant approvals and supporting documents \r\na. Approval from the land agency e.g. URA and HDB (referred to as planning permission from land agencies)* \r\nb. Tenancy agreement# \r\nc. Details of applicant - one of the following (where applicable): \r\n    i. Individual - Both sides of NRIC \r\n    ii. Company - Information Business Profile from Accounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) \r\n    iii. Society - Certificate of Registration from Registrar of Societies \r\nd. Basic food hygiene certificate/Refresher food hygiene certificate of foodhandlers \r\ne. Food hygiene officer certificate (for Food caterers, Restaurants, Foodcourts and Canteens only) \r\nf. Cleaning program \r\ng. Layout plan of premises (in scaled metric units) \r\nh. Letter of authorisation (when submission of application is not done by intended licensee/director of company holding the licence) \r\ni. Pest control contract covering the control of rodents, cockroaches and flies during the year-long licensing period. The inspection frequency of the food shop premises covered in the contract shall be at least once a month to detect any sign of pest infestation. \r\nj. Supplementary Information form to capture business name, type of food sold, business operating hours, etc. \r\nk. Food Safety Management Plan (with critical control points identified) or proof of registration for the “WSQ Apply FSMS for Food Service Establishments” course. (For Food Caterers only). Refer to the following link for more details. \r\nl. Photos showing the interior and exterior of the catering vehicle \r\nm. Vehicle log card or tenancy agreement for rental vehicle to prove ownership of catering vehicle \r\nn. Cleaning program for catering vehicle\r\n*Please note that this is potential pitfall for applicant. Applicant should ensure the relevant planning permission is obtained, prior to signing any tenancy agreement and investing in renovations/equipment for the premises. \r\n\r\nPlease notes that the submission of a tenancy agreement is not required during the initial stage of application for a licence. The tenancy agreement will only be required at the final stage, before NEA approves and issues the licence. You are advised not to sign any tenancy agreement, until the land agency concerned has approved the relevant use for the premises, and you are reasonably confident you can meet with the COPEH requirements by also verifying with the owner/landlord on the necessary renovations like installation of exhaust system, pipings for sinks etc."

Should such diversionary measures fail, the Youth Court can place the child/young person on Statutory Supervision or admit him/her into a residential facility for those who display very high risk behaviours.\r\n\r\nThe count refers to the cases by gender annually. \r\n\r\nFootnote: \r\n*BPC complaint refers to a situation where the parents had filled a BPC concerning the child but is pending court's decision.

Such students should first report at the secondary school that they were posted to on the next working day after the release of posting results, and apply for school transfer there. All applications must be accompanied with the relevant supporting documents, as follows:\r\n\r\n  * PD - An assessment of the student’s condition and needs from a qualified medical professional. It should clearly describe the extent of disability (e.g. temporary, permanent) and the type of assistive mobility device that the child is currently using (e.g. wheelchair, crutches).\r\n  * Mild SEN - A comprehensive report written by a relevant professional (e.g. psychologist, speech and language therapist). It should indicate the nature of the disability with supporting evidence for the diagnosis and provide clear description of the student’s current functioning and limitations, together with recommendations for support and intervention. Other documents may include a school report from the student’s primary school providing additional background to their condition and any other relevant documents. MOE will consider appeals for transfer to a school resourced to support mild SEN only if that school is included as one of the student’s original choice of secondary schools."

The two Tree Conservation Areas (TCAs) were selected based on the extent of greenery and the number of mature trees within the areas that are worth conserving. These mature trees provide the lush verdant and wooded ambience to enhance the beauty of the environment. Some of these trees have taken as long as 50 to 100 years to reach their present size.\n\nThe gazette requires written permission for proposals to fell any mature tree to be obtained from the Commissioner of Parks & Recreation. Mature trees are defined as trees with girth more than one metre measured half a metre from the ground. This applies to developers as well as owners of private properties and even if no development works are being undertaken.\n\nThis dataset presents the indicative extent of the two TCAs."
